QUESTION 1.  Read through the program lab9.bin. What do you expect the program to do? More specifically, which register will the program modify when it is run, and what will it contain when the program finishes? (You can probably figure this out merely by reading the comments provided in lab10.bin.)

ANSWER: It clears the value for R2 and then adds the decimal value of 12 to R2


QUESTION 2.  Explain in a few sentences why the ability to step through a program (run one instruction at a time) is a very useful tool for debugging a program. Debugging is the process of finding and correcting bugs (or errors) in a program. Hint: Finding a bug is often much more difficult than correcting it.

ANSWER: Especially in LC3 where all instructions are in binary, it is very difficult to find a bug in the first place. By stepping through a program, following it line by line, we are able to much more easily find errors and bugs in the program and thus correct it, which makes it significantly more useful than just an eye.
